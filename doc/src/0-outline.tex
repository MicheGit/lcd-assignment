\subsection{Session Types}

\begin{frame}{Session Types}
    The paper \emph{Fundamentals of Session Types} % TODO impara a fare le references [1]
    presents a $\pi$-calculus equipped with a (linear) type system to check against errors that the system can incur into.

    Such language features linear types, which allow checking whether a given channel is used by exactly one process.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Session Types - The $\pi$-calculus}
    The $\pi$-calculus' features are incrementtally presented through five sections:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{basics and fundamentals} features, as scope restriction, in sections 2 and 3;
        \item \textbf{recursive types}, needed to write useful unrestricted types, in section 4;
        \item \textbf{unbounded computations}, in section 5;
        \item \textbf{branching and selection}, in section 6.
    \end{itemize}

    The implementation process follows this very same organization, and will be presented accordingly.
